/* Machine readers used to have to make sense of all the above <div>â€™s and more. The new semantic HTML elements we learned in this chapter are like standardized versions of these class names. Now, they can simply look for a <header> element. We can still add whatever class name we want to it for styling purposes, but search engines and screen readers now have a predictable way to identify headers across every HTML5 website on the Internet. */
